## Obsidian
I use Obsidian to organize my plant-related notes, including this tissue culture resource. Iâ€™ve included all the notes I believe could be useful. However, some pages may reference linked PDFs or other external files that are not included in this export due to potential copyright concerns.

I apologize for any confusion caused by missing files. If you encounter issues with incomplete information, please open an issue, and I will either remove or adjust the affected page accordingly.

Additionally, if you find any personal information within the notes, I kindly ask that you open an issue so I can address it.
