# **Rooting and Acclimatization**
_Preparing plantlets for survival outside the sterile culture environment._

## **Why Rooting & Acclimatization Matters**
- Ensures plantlets **develop strong roots** before transfer to soil.
- Prevents **shock and dehydration** during transition.
- Helps plants **adjust to natural environmental conditions**.

---

## **1️⃣ Root Induction in Culture**
Before acclimatization, plantlets must establish **a strong root system**.

### **A. Choosing the Right Rooting Media**
| **Medium** | **Auxin Used** | **Best For** |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **MS with low cytokinin** | IAA (0.5-2 mg/L) | General rooting |
| **½-strength MS** | IBA (0.5-2 mg/L) | Stronger roots |
| **½-strength MS + activated charcoal** | NAA (0.2-1 mg/L) | Delicate tissues |

> 🌱 **Tip:** Lower nutrient concentration encourages **root formation** instead of shoot proliferation.

---

### **B. Rooting Process**
1. Transfer **healthy shoots** from multiplication media to **root-inducing media**.
2. Ensure **gentle placement**—do not bury the base too deep.
3. Maintain **high humidity** and **moderate light levels**.
4. Observe for **root initiation within 2-4 weeks**.

## **2️⃣ Preparing for Acclimatization**
Once rooted, plantlets need to **adjust to external conditions**.

### **A. Stepwise Hardening**
| **Stage** | **Conditions** | **Duration** |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Stage 1** | High humidity (90%), indirect light | 3-7 days |
| **Stage 2** | Gradual exposure to lower humidity (70-80%) | 1-2 weeks |
| **Stage 3** | Transfer to non-sterile soil under controlled conditions | 2+ weeks |
| **Stage 4** | Move to greenhouse or outdoor environment | Ongoing |

> 💡 **Tip:** Cover plantlets with a **humidity dome** or use a **misting system** to prevent dehydration.

---

### **B. Transferring to Soil**
1. **Gently remove plantlets** from culture media—wash off excess agar.
2. Dip roots in **rooting hormone (optional)** for stronger establishment.
3. Plant in **sterile potting mix** (peat moss, vermiculite, perlite mix).
4. Water lightly with **sterile water**—avoid overwatering.
5. Place under **indirect light** and gradually expose to natural conditions.

---

## **3️⃣ Monitoring & Common Issues**
- **Wilting?** → Increase humidity or mist frequently.
- **Yellowing leaves?** → Reduce transplant shock with gradual exposure.
- **Fungal growth?** → Improve ventilation and use a mild antifungal spray.
