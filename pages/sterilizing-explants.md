# **Sterilizing  Explants**
_Proper sterilization is crucial to prevent contamination and ensure successful tissue culture._

## **Why Sterilization is Important**
Plant tissue culture requires a completely **sterile environment** because:
- Microorganisms (bacteria, fungi) can **outcompete plant tissues**.
- Contamination **ruins cultures**, leading to losses.
- Even a **single unsterile step** can cause failure.

## **Sterilization Process**
To properly sterilize an explant, follow these steps:

### **1️⃣ Pre-Wash the Explant**
- Rinse in **lukewarm soapy water** to remove dirt and debris.
- Optionally, soak in **fungicide solution** (e.g., Captan) for 5-10 minutes.
- Rinse thoroughly with **sterile distilled water**.

### **2️⃣ Surface Sterilization**
Common disinfectants used in tissue culture:

| **Solution** | **Concentration** | **Soaking Time** | **Purpose** |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| **Ethanol (70%)** | 70% (v/v) | 30 seconds - 1 min | Kills bacteria and fungi |
| **Sodium Hypochlorite (Bleach)** | 10-15% commercial bleach | 10-15 minutes | General sterilization |
| **Hydrogen Peroxide (H₂O₂)** | 3-10% | 5-15 minutes | Kills spores and fungi |
| **Mercuric Chloride (HgCl₂)** | 0.1% | 1-5 minutes | Strong but highly toxic |
| **Silver Nitrate (AgNO₃)** | 1-5% | 5 minutes | Effective against bacteria |

> ⚠ **Safety Note:** **Mercuric chloride** is highly toxic and should only be used in regulated labs.

### **3️⃣ Final Rinses**
- Rinse **3-5 times** in **sterile distilled water** to remove chemical residues.
- Some protocols use a **buffered rinse** (e.g., sterile phosphate buffer) to neutralize sterilants.

## **Tips for Success**
✔ Use **freshly prepared solutions** for maximum effectiveness.  
✔ Avoid **over-sterilization**, as it can damage plant tissues.  
✔ Some species require **gentler methods** (e.g., lower bleach concentration for delicate tissues).  
✔ Work **quickly but carefully** to keep tissues from drying out.
