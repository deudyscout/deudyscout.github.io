# **Final Transfer to Soil**
_The last step in plant tissue culture—moving plantlets from a controlled environment to natural soil._

## **Why the Final Transfer is Important**
- Ensures **long-term survival** outside sterile conditions.
- Helps plantlets **adapt to external stressors** (light, humidity, soil microbes).
- Prepares plants for **field planting or pot cultivation**.

## **1️⃣ Selecting the Right Soil**
The transition medium should provide **good drainage and aeration** while retaining moisture.

| **Soil Type**           | **Composition**              | **Best For**            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Sterile Potting Mix** | Peat + perlite + vermiculite | General plantlets       |
| **Loamy Garden Soil**   | Sand + silt + clay           | Hardier species         |
| **Coco Peat Mix**       | Coconut fiber + perlite      | High moisture retention |
| **Sandy Soil**          | Sand + compost               | Xerophytic plants       |

> 🌱 **Tip:** Start with **sterilized potting soil** to minimize contamination risks.

## **2️⃣ Preparing Plantlets for Transfer**
1. **Water the plants** a few hours before transfer to reduce transplant shock.
2. **Gently remove plantlets** from acclimatization trays—avoid damaging roots.
3. **Wash off excess agar** with sterile distilled water (if needed).
4. **Dip roots in mycorrhizal inoculant** (optional) to enhance soil adaptation.

> ⚠ **Warning:** Avoid direct sun exposure **immediately after transplanting**.

---

## **3️⃣ Planting Process**
1. **Fill pots or planting trays** with pre-moistened soil.
2. **Make a small hole** and gently place the plantlet—cover roots lightly.
3. **Water lightly** to settle the soil—do not overwater!
4. **Keep in a shaded area** for 3-7 days before introducing full sunlight.

> 💡 **Tip:** Use a **humidity dome or misting system** to maintain high humidity for the first few days.

## **4️⃣ Post-Transfer Care**
| **Factor** | **Recommended Conditions** |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Light** | Indirect for 3-7 days, then gradual sun exposure |
| **Humidity** | Maintain 60-80% initially, then reduce |
| **Watering** | Keep soil moist but not soggy |
| **Fertilization** | Start light feeding after 2-3 weeks |
| **Pest & Disease Check** | Monitor for fungus, damping-off, and pests |

> 🌿 **Growth Milestone:** If new leaves appear **within 2-3 weeks**, the plantlet has successfully adapted!

---

## **5️⃣ Moving to Outdoor Conditions**
- Harden plants **gradually**—increase outdoor exposure daily.
- Once fully established, transplant into **larger pots or garden soil**.
- Monitor for **growth, pests, and water needs**.

> 🚀 **Success!** Your tissue culture plant is now ready for long-term growth.
