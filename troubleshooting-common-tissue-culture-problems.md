# **Troubleshooting Common Tissue Culture Problems**
_Identifying and solving issues in plant tissue culture for better success rates._

## **Why Troubleshooting is Important**
- Prevents **wasted resources** and culture failures.
- Improves **plant survival rates** by addressing key issues early.
- Helps optimize conditions for **better growth and propagation**.

---

## **1️⃣ Contamination Issues**
_One of the most common problems in tissue culture._

### **Symptoms & Causes**
| **Symptom** | **Possible Cause** | **Solution** |
|------------|------------------|------------|
| **White, fluffy growth** | Fungal contamination | Discard contaminated cultures, improve sterilization. |
| **Cloudy media, slime** | Bacterial contamination | Use antibiotics in media (e.g., cefotaxime). |
| **Blackening tissue** | Fungal infection, phenolic oxidation | Improve explant sterilization, use activated charcoal. |

> 🔬 **Prevention:** Work in a **laminar flow hood**, use freshly sterilized tools, and monitor for early contamination.

---

## **2️⃣ Browning & Tissue Necrosis**
_Explants turn brown and die prematurely._

### **Causes & Solutions**
| **Cause** | **Solution** |
|----------|------------|
| **Phenolic oxidation** (common in woody plants) | Add **antioxidants** (ascorbic acid, citric acid), use activated charcoal. |
| **Explant stress from sterilization** | Reduce bleach/hydrogen peroxide exposure time. |
| **Excessive light exposure** | Reduce light intensity or duration. |

> 🌱 **Tip:** Transfer browning tissues to fresh media quickly to prevent further damage.

---

## **3️⃣ Slow or No Growth**
_Explants fail to develop into callus, shoots, or roots._

### **Possible Causes & Fixes**
| **Issue** | **Solution** |
|----------|------------|
| **Improper hormone balance** | Adjust **cytokinin-to-auxin ratio** for the desired growth. |
| **Old or degraded media** | Use freshly prepared, properly stored media. |
| **Explants too mature** | Use **younger tissues** for better regeneration potential. |

> ⚠ **Note:** Some species require a **dark incubation period** for callus induction.

---

## **4️⃣ Excessive Callus Formation**
_Too much undifferentiated tissue, no shoot or root development._

### **Fixes:**
- Reduce **auxin concentration** (NAA, 2,4-D).
- Increase **cytokinin levels** to promote shoot formation.
- Transfer callus to fresh media with a better **hormone balance**.

> 🚀 **Goal:** Encourage organized shoot/root formation rather than excessive callus.

---

## **5️⃣ Abnormal Shoots or Roots**
_Weak, deformed, or hyperhydric plantlets._

### **Common Causes & Solutions**
| **Problem** | **Cause** | **Fix** |
|------------|---------|------|
| **Hyperhydricity (glassiness, translucent tissue)** | High humidity, excess cytokinins | Increase ventilation, reduce cytokinin concentration. |
| **Thin, weak shoots** | Poor light intensity | Adjust light source and duration. |
| **Rootless shoots** | Too much cytokinin, not enough auxin | Increase auxin concentration (IBA, NAA). |

> 🌍 **Tip:** Gradually adapt plantlets to non-sterile conditions to strengthen growth.

---

## **6️⃣ Yellowing & Leaf Drop**
_Leaves lose color and fall off prematurely._

### **Possible Causes & Solutions**
| **Cause** | **Solution** |
|----------|------------|
| **Nutrient deficiency** | Use full-strength media (MS medium with proper nutrients). |
| **pH imbalance** | Adjust media pH to **5.6-5.8** before autoclaving. |
| **Overexposure to light** | Reduce light intensity, increase humidity. |

> 🔬 **Check:** If yellowing starts **after rooting**, gradually introduce nutrients through light fertilization.

---

## **7️⃣ Poor Acclimatization Survival**
_Plantlets fail to adapt to soil conditions._

### **Fixes:**
- Increase **humidity gradually** (use a humidity dome).
- Reduce **direct sunlight exposure** for the first week.
- Use **sterile soil mix** to prevent infections.
- Avoid **overwatering**—moist, not soggy soil is ideal.

> 🌱 **Milestone:** If new growth appears **within 2-3 weeks**, the plant has successfully acclimated!
